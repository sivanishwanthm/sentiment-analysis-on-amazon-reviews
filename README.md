# sentiment-analysis-on-amazon-reviews
In today's digital world, online reviews hold immense power. They not only shape customer decisions but also directly impact a brand's reputation. To achieve 100% customer satisfaction, understanding the sentiment behind these reviews is crucial. This project uses  a rich dataset of Amazon food reviews, which encompasses a wide variety of products, user profiles, and most importantly, emotions. Our goal is to extract valuable insights from this data, identifying patterns and trends that show what customers truly feel about the food they're buying. We'll not only explore what people say, but also go deeper to understand why some reviews contradict the given star rating. By using sentiment analysis tools like VADER and Roberta, we'll uncover the emotional undercurrents of these reviews. This analysis will look at reviews with seemingly illogical sentiment, such as positive reviews with a single star rating. Ultimately, this project aims to use the power of customer reviews to provide businesses with actionable insights that can be used to improve both products and services.
